# CAcert
Check Issued Certificates from CA and email the report.<br>
Certutil is used to capture all certificates and convert to CSV.<br>
Powershell will convert from CSV and compile the report to be sent by E-mail.

# WHY
built and used because certutil was not able to give me reporting I needed on certificates issued from a CA.
